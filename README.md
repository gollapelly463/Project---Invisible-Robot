 # Project---Invisible-Robot
The **Invisible Robot** is an autonomous robotic system designed primarily for military applications to enhance soldier safety in high-risk environments. This robot moves ahead of soldiers during missions to detect obstacles, threats, or dangerous conditions before human personnel proceed, thereby reducing risk to human life. Once activated, it operates automatically, navigating forward on its own while continuously scanning its surroundings using sensors to detect and intelligently avoid obstacles. A built-in camera captures real-time visuals of the environment, which are displayed on a 5-inch or 7-inch flat screen mounted on the robot. This live display helps the robot blend with its surroundings, creating an “invisible” effect that makes it less noticeable to enemies. The robot is uniquely designed in a tortoise shape, symbolizing protection, safety, and durability, aligning with its mission of safeguarding soldiers. The current phase of the project focuses on autonomous movement, obstacle detection, and live environmental visualization, while future development will include sending alert signals and real-time danger notifications to military personnel, along with advanced communication and tracking features.
